## Setup & Run (in Colab)

1. *Install all required packages*:

```bash
!pip install streamlit transformers torchaudio audiocraft git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git pydub pyngrok
!apt-get install -y ffmpeg
```

2. **Create the app.py file** with the full Streamlit logic (already included).

3. **Run the app using ngrok to expose Streamlit UI**:

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
!kill $(pgrep streamlit) || echo "No streamlit running"
get_ipython().system_raw("streamlit run app.py &")
public_url = ngrok.connect(port="8501")
print(f"ðŸ”— Open your app here: {public_url}")
```
